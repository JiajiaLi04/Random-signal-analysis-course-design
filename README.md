# Random-signal-analysis-course-design
- Design a cosine signal X (t) which is randomly distributed uniformly in phase, draw autocorrelation function and power spectrum.
- Simulation of Gaussian white noise N (t), drawing autocorrelation function and power spectrum.
- Draw the autocorrelation function and power spectral density of X (t) + N (t).
